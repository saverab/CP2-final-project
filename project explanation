For my final project for this CP2 class I created a search engine which I feel that I could see in a fashion app.
I wanted for the user to be able search a term and find the most used hashtags which coorilate with the search term. 
For example, when searching for the designer Alexander Wang popular hashtags that come up wpuld be adidas, denim,
NewYorkFashionWeek, and BellaHadid. 
I created this project by taking information from the twitter API, I then loaded on the screen a few examples that began
with hashtags that were used in tweets with the mentioned key words. I then simplified the viewing processes by only displaying
one hashtag at a time and making the more mentioned tags apear larger. I also added a search bar to make it more interactive for
the users.
